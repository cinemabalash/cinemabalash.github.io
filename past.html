  <h1>AUGUST 3RD, 2018<br>7PM

  <br>An OPENING OF OPENINGS:<br></h1><h4>

To celebrate our opening night, we have asked artists and friends
to choose an opening scene from any movie they wish.<br>

Opening scenes can be masterpieces in their
own right. Even mediocre films sometimes have remarkable openings.
<br>
This evening will be a continuous screening of openings: a full-
length screening of a never-ending movie.<br>
<br>
