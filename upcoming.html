<br>  <br>DOUBLE FEATURE<br></h1><h4>

Following the Opening of Opening, Cinema Balash presents
double bills of the full features from which opening scenes were drawn from during
the opening night. <br>
<br>
The first in this series will be Ingmar Bergman's "The Magic Flute" and Juzo
Itami's "Tampopo".

<br>
<br>
<h1>The Magic Flute</h1><h4>
Considered the greatest adaptation of opera to film Bergman's 1975 movie
brings Mozart's work to the cinema not as theater, a stage, built and performed on for a camera, theatrical effects
displayed through cinematic means.</h4>

<br>
<h1>Tampopo</h1><h4>
Itami's "Tampopo" 'Ramen Western' is a sincere celebration of food, sex and film genres.<br>
It is one of the  most life- and film- affirming movies ever made. Don't miss this chance to see it on the big screen!
