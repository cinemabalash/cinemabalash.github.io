<h4>PROGRAM</h4>

<b><h2>Be Cute, Now!</h2></b>
<i>4 min, 2017, MHS</i><br>

Why do people turn into filmmakers once they become parents? What are they trying to capture when filming their children, treating them as adorably charismatic hosts of talk show with an audience of few? And what if their children don't follow the script?
<br>
<b><h2>Cantaprota</h2></b>
<i>13 min, 2018, MHS</i><br>

This documentary short features locals singing and playing the songs of their childhood. Produced during a creative residency through the Sabinarti Cultural Association at the Palazzo del Gatto in Casaprota, Italy.
<br>
<b><h2>Laura in Search of Teeth</h2></b>
<i>33 min, 2018, MHS</i><br>

Laura L. Brown is a collector of oddities, Facebook entertainer, and self-proclaimed Christian Hippie Freak living in McMinnville, Oregon. Her family is still getting used to it. An intimate look at life, death, trauma, and the wonders of formaldehyde. The film features an original score by Megan Hattie Stahl and Nate Terepka.
